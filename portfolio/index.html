                    I have had the opportunity to work with a company called Elish Paribahan, where I was part of a team
                    that created a website and an Android application. This project involved a lot of teamwork and
                    collaboration, as well as problem solving, which are skills I am proud to have developed through
                    this experience.

                    Additionally, I worked for BDapps Lite, where I was able to gain experience with developing mobile
                    applications. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
